# Data-Analysis-in-FIFA-dataset
In this project, I will perform simple exploratory data analysis of the FIFA 19 data set. The data set can be found on Kaggle. FIFA is the Fédération Internationale de Football Association and FIFA 19 is part of the FIFA series of association football video games. It is one of the best selling video games of all time selling over 260 million copies to date.

For this analysis we will be using the python pandas library, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib. The dataset contains 89 columns but we will limit our analysis to the following ten columns:

Name — Name of Player
Age — Age of Player
Nationality — Nationality of Player
Value — Current Market Value
Wage — Wage of Player
Preferred Foot — Preferred foot of player
Height — Height of Player
Weight — Weight of player
