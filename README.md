# Data-Analysis-in-FIFA-dataset
In this project, I will perform simple exploratory data analysis of the FIFA 19 data set. The data set can be found on Kaggle. FIFA is the Fédération Internationale de Football Association and FIFA 19 is part of the FIFA series of association football video games. It is one of the best selling video games of all time selling over 260 million copies to date.

For this analysis we will be using the python pandas library, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib.
